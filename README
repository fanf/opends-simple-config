What's about ?
==============
This project provides a strip down version of the OpenDS configuration file
to embed it in your application. There is also a demo program which show
what file are required, and how to start/stop the server from code.

OpenDS : http://www.opends.org/
I use OpenDS (v2.2.0) : http://www.opends.org/promoted-builds/2.2.0/
Most of that project are direct transcription of instructions found
in OpenDS wiki:
- Creating an OpenDS Instance for Embedded Use :

- Controlling OpenDS from Another Application

Goal
====

The goal was to remove the most things from the OpenDS configuration file, 
to use OpenDS for testing or such goal. 

Most of the useful administration things, what make OpenDS 
an Entreprise Level directory server and not just a
cool open source project, are removed here.

I also removed the BerkeleyDB back-end to use an in memory one 
and being able to remove the je.jar dependency. If you need a 
persistent backend, revert commit 16b8284b4e2c453cd6fd1d30f9f2dda8259ff4fe

Demo programm
=============

The demo programm is here to show what is required to launch
OpenDS: what directory to create, what file to copy.
It is in Scala, but the java version will be almost the same.

As I use Maven for almost all my dependency management, the
demo use maven for building/testing. 

To test the program, build it:

% mvn assembly:assembly
% java -cp target/embedded-opends-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.test.Main

Installing needed jars in your local maven repos
================================================

AFAIK, OpenDS is not available in a Maven repository since 
version 1.0.0, so you will have to install at least 3 required
dependencies: OpenDS, Quicksetup, and BerkeleyDB.
For that, download the zip distribution,
unzip it, go to OenDS-XXX directory, and then:

% mvn install:install-file -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true -Dfile=lib/je.jar         -DgroupId=com.sleepycat -DartifactId=je         -Dversion=3.3.87 
% mvn install:install-file -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true -Dfile=lib/quicksetup.jar -DgroupId=org.opends    -DartifactId=quicksetup -Dversion=2.2.0 
% mvn install:install-file -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true -Dfile=lib/OpenDS.jar     -DgroupId=org.opends    -DartifactId=opends     -Dversion=2.2.0
